Created a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills. The project involved custom design and implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The most challenging part was optimizing the website for performance and ensuring cross-browser compatibility, which I achieved through extensive testing and optimization techniques.
